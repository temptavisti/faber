    <p class="text_column"><i>August 16, 2353</i><br><!--his inaction, after the chase, on his bus to yonder-->&nbsp;I know, I know. I swore never to come back to this blog, but protecting my identity seems pretty silly now. I will keep this brief, anyway. I am filled with regrets, mostly stemming from my cowardice. I have made another mistake, and, again, it has cost someone else. The man from my last post (has it really been that long), my <i>friend</i>, is being chased out of the city in fear of his life, all because of a device which I created, which I encouraged him to use. I am to blame, and yet he is the one paying the price. If I had never met him, if I had never spoken to him in that park just over a year ago, he would have never left his happy life, he would still have him home and his job and his wife. I am truly sorry, Montag, even though it probably does not matter at this point, considering you are most likely dead at this time. The hound is inescapable, everyone knows that.<br>&nbsp;I will come back to this blog, in time, when it seems safe to do so. For now, however, I must sign off. I have a bad feeling about this "war" on all the radios.</p>
    <p class="text_column"><i>July 13, 2352</i><br><!--he came back, why, explaining his new hope--> Hello, again. I know that I promised never to return because it would put me in too much danger, should someone discover my identity, but something very important happened today which rekindled my hope. I met a man today, a fire man, and yet we had an actual conversation. I hope he has not called an alarm on me, but it has not happened yet. Just in case, though, I will write as if this is my last. But first, let me explain what happened today.<br>
I spend many days in the park, despite how dangerous it is to say that on this public platform. It is rare to come across another person while I am sitting out there. Today, however, was different. Someone else arrived, the fire man, and he only wanted to talk. When he left, he seemed a changed man. Perhaps this is progress for our society. Oh, how I miss the days of my professorship. I could speak freely, challenge the students to think independently. Now, all I can do is sit and complain to no one. <em><font size="2px" color="#666666">(read more...)</font></em><!-- "He remembered nothing like it save one afternoon ayear ago when he had met an old man in the park and they had talked ...." --></p>
    <p class="text_column"><i>March 25, 2321</i><br>It is becoming more and more dangerous each day to write, to teach, to post these on here. Despite that, I cannot bring myself to delete this blog. I will have to be more cautious, though, as I am beginning to notice things that may be deemed "offensive" disappearing from the web, from the shelves. My classes are getting less interested, less engaged. They fear retaliation from their peers, should they say anything that the group is not unanimously agreed upon. It saddens me greatly, to see such bright minds shying away from deep analysis. Some remain curious, but they are getting rarer and rarer.<br>&nbsp;This society that we are living in, this world where we allow ourselves to live in fear of our peers in unhealthy. I know I should do something about it. And yet, as usual, I am frozen, paranoid. I criticize our society, and yet I am a complacent part of it. I am too cowardly to do anything, and at the same time too cowardly to remove myself from this society I hate so much. <em><font size="2px" color="#666666">(read more...)</font></em><!--censorship, not going to be blogging for awhile--></p>
